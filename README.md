# Steps to run on localhost:
1. Clone both this backend repository and the linked front end repository above. You will need both to be running simultaneously for the application to work properly. 
2. After you have both cloned, navigate into the back end server repository and the api folder. 
3. Once in the API folder in a terminal, run the command 'npm install' to install all of the packages needed to run the backend server. 
4. Once the libraries have finished installing, you should then run the command 'npm start' to start the backend development server. From the command terminal, you will recieve two output messages to let you know the backend server is running and that the connection to the database was successful. 
5. After you recieve these messages, it is time to switch to the FrontEnd/UI Repository. Once in the FrontEnd/UI Repository in a command terminal, navigate to the flix-movie-streaming folder and again run 'npm install' to install all of the required libraries and 'npm start' to start the front end development server.
6. Once complete your browser should open up a window to the Front End UI running on Port 3000. You will likely need to sign up for an account in order to log in and see all features of the UI. If you would not like to create an account, I have created a test account in the database for anyone to use. The details are below.
